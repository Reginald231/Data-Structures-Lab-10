# Data-Structures-Lab-10
The goal of this lab is to reinforce binary tree concepts. Specifically, this lab is to do problem #1 on page 534 of the text. You need to complete the solution. Edit: The solution has been completed. An incomplete solution has been uploaded.

There is one function that needs to be implemented -- evaluate() in the expression_tree.cpp file, but I used about 3 functions to keep things organized and concise for the program.

Note for the complete solution, the output should print 29 for the value. The solution for this lab involves the use of recursion.
